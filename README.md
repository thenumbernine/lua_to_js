### Lua to JavaScript Transpiler

Unfinished but easy to work with.  Right now less than 300 LOC sitting on top of my lua-parser library. 

This has so much in common with my Lua to C project that I should really just find some generic AST superset of all languages and write an exporter to/from each language.
(Kind of like I am already doing in my SymMath project's equation exporter / code generation).
